<h3><a href="/cts">Chemical Transformation Simulator</a></h3>
<p>
The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) provides the calculated physicochemical properties
of the parent chemical and transformation products, which are predicted as a function of the
reaction system of interest. This is accomplished through the integration of cheminformatics
applications for the encoding of process science underlying transformation pathways, computational
chemistry tools for the calculation of physicochemical properties, and software technologies
that provide access to on-line databases for environmental descriptors required for estimating
environmental concentrations.

<h3><a href="/hms">Hydrological Micro Services</a></h3>
<p>
Hydrological Micro Services (HMS) provides component and model data services relates to hydrology (e.g.,
evapotranspiration, precipitation, surface runoff, subsurface flow, soil moisture, temperature) and
water quality (e.g., chemistry, eutrophication, mercury, microbes, nutrients, pH levels, sediment and
temperature).

<h3><a href="/pisces">Piscine Stream Community Estimation Ssytem</a></h3>
<p>
PiSCES delivers a fish assemblage for any NHD-Plus stream reach in the conterminous United States by
referencing HUC-based distributional information for over 1,000 native and non-native species obtained from
NatureServe, the USGS, and the Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes of North America. In addition to
using current geographic distributions, PiSCES can refine potential communities to reflect information on
species rarity, stream size preferences, and occurrence envelopes for water quality metrics (pH, conductivity,
turbidity, dissolved oxygen) and stream characteristics (watershed area, mean width, depth, and slope).
 PiSCES can also create an abundance distribution for a fish community using an approach that associates
 abundance of a species to its maximum body size.
