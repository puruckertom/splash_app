<h3><a href="/cts">Chemical Transformation Simulator</a></h3>
<p>
The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) provides the calculated physico-chemical properties
of the parent chemical and transformation products, which are predicted as a function of the
reaction system of interest. This is accomplished through the integration of cheminformatics
applications for the encoding of process science underlying transformation pathways, computational
chemistry tools for the calculation of physico-chemical properties, and software technologies
that provide access to on-line databases for environmental descriptors required for estimating
environmental concentrations.

<h3><a href="/cyan">Cyanobacteria Assessment Network</a></h3>
<p>
The Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) is a multi-agency project among the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and EPA to develop an early warning indicator system using
historical and current satellite data to detect algal blooms in U.S. freshwater systems. This
research supports federal, state, and local partners in their monitoring efforts to assess water
quality to protect aquatic and human health.

<h3><a href="/hms">Hydrological Micro Services</a></h3>
<p>
Hydrological Micro Services (HMS) provides component and model data services relates to hydrology (e.g.,
evapotranspiration, precipitation, surface runoff, subsurface flow, soil moisture, temperature) and
water quality (e.g., chemistry, eutrophication, mercury, microbes, nutrients, pH levels, sediment and
temperature).

<h3><a href="/hwbi">Human Well-Being Index</a></h3>
<p>
The Human Well-Being Index (HWBI) was generated using over one hundred nationally-available data layers to
assess economic, social, and ecosystem services across the entire U.S. at the regional, state, and
county levels for years 2000-2010.  Input data consisted of both subjective and objective information and
included sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and others. These data were evaluated
using multiple linear regression and relationship-function statistical techniques to identify
correlations and calculate coefficient values for each service. The HWBI model uses the resultant
coefficients to process 22 economic, ecosystem, and social services values to calculate a total HWBI
score as well as eight values for the "domains of well-being": Connection to Nature, Cultural Fulfillment,
Education, Health, Leisure Time, Living Standards, Safety & Security, and Social Cohesion.

<h3><a href="/pisces">Piscine Stream Community Estimation Ssytem</a></h3>
<p>
PiSCES delivers a fish assemblage for any NHD-Plus stream reach in the conterminous United States by
referencing HUC-based distributional information for over 1,000 native and non-native species obtained from
NatureServe, the USGS, and the Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes of North America. In addition to
using current geographic distributions, PiSCES can refine potential communities to reflect information on
species rarity, stream size preferences, and occurrence envelopes for water quality metrics (pH, conductivity,
turbidity, dissolved oxygen) and stream characteristics (watershed area, mean width, depth, and slope).
 PiSCES can also create an abundance distribution for a fish community using an approach that associates
 abundance of a species to its maximum body size.

<h3><a href="/ubertool">ubertool: Ecological risk pesticide registration models</a></h3>
<p>
The übertool is a cloud-based web application platform that includes a variety of aquatic, terrestrial and
atmospheric deposition fate and transport models used by the EPA for the ecological risk assessment of pesticides.
The science models in the übertool provide predictions concerning chemical concentrations in environmental
media, exposure doses, tissue residues and ultimately predictions of effects. These predictions are relevant
for a number of ecological species under regulations that the EPA is responsible for, including the registration
of pesticides and the protection of endangered species.

<h3><a href="/sam">Spatial Aquatic Model</a></h3>
<p>
The Spatial Aquatic Model (SAM) is an exposure model designed to simulate the magnitude, duration, and location of
aquatic exposure concentrations of pesticides. Pesticide concentrations are estimated as a function of chemical
properties, environmental factors, and crop/management practices. Outputs include pesticide exposure concentrations
in a receiving water body at the watershed or basin level. Concentrations also can be compared to user-defined
toxicity thresholds in output tables, maps, and summary histograms to characterize the duration, frequency, and
location of exceedances.
