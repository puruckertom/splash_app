A general Wiki oriented towards developers is available <a href='https://github.com/quanted/qed/wiki'>here</a>. This
page summarizes the state of environmental variables defined in the
<a href='https://github.com/quanted/temp_config/'>temp_config</a> repository.

<p>
Django initial default settings can be found in the django/conf/global_settings.py file. Default django settings
and temp_config environmental variables are also added and/or modified in the settings.py and *_settings.py
files in the qed root directory. Otherwise, Django settings should not be altered at runtime.
